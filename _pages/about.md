My research interest includes multiaxial fatigue, visco-plasticity constitutive model, and data-driven mechanics. Up to now (Aug. 2023), I have published over 10 papers in the International Journal of Fatigue, International Journal of Mechanical Science, International Journal of Solids and Structures, and so on. I hope to explore the essence of material deformation in the field of structural integrity and establish a reliable descriptive model. If you have any interest in cooperation, please don't hesitate to contact me.
